        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>

               My Name is Ishan Priya. My favorite hobby is chess. Chess is a very old game and has evolved many times. In the old days, Chess was called Chaturanga. At that time Queens were the weakest pieces! Now the Queens are the most powerful.  Chess is  a game of war complete with Kings, Queens, Elephants, Archers, Horses, and Warriors. Each piece has its own signifacance but two goals: Attack the other king and defend your own king.  While fulfilling my love for strategic games it also is a fun way to pass the time. I consider myself pretty good, I know I have a long way to go before becoming a Grandmaster at the game. My favorite player of chess is Magnus Carlsen the World Champion and International Master at age 13. He is my role model in chess and I always vote for him to win tournaments. I sometimes take strategies from him into my game such as piece maneuvering. Overall, chess is a nice way to get your brain thinking and a great way to have fun for me.
